# Building Models {#building-models}

In our haste to make progress --- to get all the way through the process of building, interpreting and using models --- we have given shortshrift to some of the messy details of model building. This chapter fills in those lacunae.

<!-- This could have been chaper 10, but I like showing logistic earlier, since it can appear on the third exam.  -->

<!-- Topics include: -->

<!-- * taking logs. When? Why? Doing so on dependent variable is a much bigger deal than doing it on independent variables since the former changes he very essence of the model. You can't really (?) compare two different models if one has taken logs of Y and one has not. -->

<!-- * standardizing variables. Key advantage is to make the coefficients easier to interpret. Even though the "right" thing to do in looking at models is to use posterior_* to look at model predictions, this takes some time. It is very handy, first pass, to look at all the coefficients and get a sense of which ones are "interesting." Then, focus on those when making newobs tibbles. -->

<!-- * Keeping or throwing away variables. How do we decide? If something is big and significant, we always keep it. If it is small and insignificant, we don't, unless our audience really wants to see it. If a mix, reasonable people differ. No right answer! -->

<!-- * Creating new variables, especially by combining different ones into one combined variable. -->
