**/.DS_Store

# Never check in caches. This file name is set in book_start.R

cache-directory

# This is where RStudio builds the book. Files are transfered to output_dir
# once the build is complete.

_bookdown_files

# Not sure I should need this:

_book


# When a compile fails, this file is left in the workspace. We never want
# to commit/push it.

book_temp.Rmd

# Everyone has a local junk directory where stuff gets built, but it is not checked in.

junk/*


# I get annoyed at checking in a libs/ folder everywhere, but maybe we should
# check them in? If you don't, then, unless you have build the html
# file for a chapter yourself, it won't show up nicely when you open it.

# **/*libs

# I don't think that it matters that these files are not pushed for each chapter.
# Might need to revisit this if we start cache'ing results so that the book builds faster.

# **/*_files/

# **/*log
# **/*tex
# **/rsconnect


# No matter what happens above, everything in docs/ must be checked in

!docs/*

# Only the book-builder needs to deal with this file. It gets replaced
# everytime you knit a chapter, so it should just be ignored.
