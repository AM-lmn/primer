# Other Outcomes {-}

In previous chapters our outcome variable has been, more or less, continuous and not-overly-different from normally distributed. In such situations, the default choice for the `family` argument to `stan_glm()`, which is `guassian()`, has worked well. This has corresponded situations in which $\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma$.

What happens when this assumption is too far away from the reality of our data?
