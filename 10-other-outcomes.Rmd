# Other Outcomes {#other-outcomes}

In previous chapters our outcome variable has been, more or less, continuous and not-overly-different from normally distributed. In such situations, the default choice for the `family` argument to `stan_glm()`, which is `guassian()`, has worked well. This has corresponded situations in which $\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma$.

What happens when this assumption is too far away from the reality of our data? 

<!-- Chapter 10 could become: various left-hand side variables, including at least logistic, and maybe something else. Can't hurt to just redo everything in chapter 9, but with logistic now. If we redo with shaming, then we can show how this gives the same answers for some stuff, but different answers for predictions.  -->

<!-- Note that there is a bunch of the relevant math and other useful material in an older version of Chapter 12 from PPBDS. Should pull that out, at least some of it. -->
